Supposed to be an unreinforced masonry CAD program, but I guess I'm doing UI stuff first. Learning Rust, Bevy, and egui as I go!

Applying some lessons I learned when seeing tradespeople interact with increasingly complex software (and their increasingly complex UI), I've come up with a **Territory Tabs** UI design that should be easier to work with while still being flexible enough for CAD software.

Basic Territory collisions and resizing.
